# Pebbling-Game
Find the maximum profit of an undirected graph rooted at any vertex

A file will be passed in with n vertices and every node on the graph will have a profit number associated with it. To find the maximum profit you
will choose to pebble nodes with a higher profit value, but two pebbled nodes can not be connected. The connected nodes will be displayed at the end with
the maximum profit value.
